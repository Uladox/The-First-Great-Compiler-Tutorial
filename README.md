# The-First-Great-Compiler-Tutorial
Due to my failure to find a good compiler tutorial, this thing exists.

More "information" can be found in the org file.

Use emacs or [vim with org mode](https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode) to open.

Or if you are online you can veiw it, though it does not look as cool.

I use org mode because I am lazy, sue me.
Except you can't because I am using the Apache lisence 2.0.

# Goal
The goal of this is to implement a subset of the interesting
parts of the scheme programming language.
